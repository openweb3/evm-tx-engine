# evm-tx-engine

`evm-tx-engine` is a high-performance `EVM transaction on-chain engine`. It not only enables fast transaction on-chain, but also hides and handles complex on-chain details, including `nonce management`, `transaction retry`, and `automatic gas payment`. It can greatly reduce the workload of Web3 system development, allowing developers to focus on business development.

This project is still under development, not ready for useage now.
